# ubuntu-setup
This repository is for a setup script to quickly install Appcove developer software on new machines

--

To use this script, simply clone this repo, enter the `ubuntu-setup` directory, and run
`./Setup.sh`

You will need to keep an eye on it when the script is running. User input is required at several points during installations.

Be sure to read the output when the script is done running. It will tell you what windowing manager you are using, and how to switch it if necessary.
